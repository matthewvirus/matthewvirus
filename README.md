Hello🖖, my name is Matthew, i studying in Minsk radio engineering college. 
I'm self-taught programmer🧑‍💻, i've learn coding for 5 years. 

My coding way was started form C++, when my mom bought for me book "Beginning C++ through game programming🎮.

For today I've tried many programming languages (C#, C++, Java, Python, Kotlin) but recently Flutter has appeared in my life and I starting my career as mobile developer📲.
